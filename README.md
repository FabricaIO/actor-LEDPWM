# actor-LEDPWM
 Interfaces with [LEDC](https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/api/ledc.html) for controlling LEDs via PWM. Can also be used for generic PWM control.
 
 NB: the PlatformIO version of LEDC [is out of date](https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/migration_guides/2.x_to_3.0.html?highlight=ledcattachpin#ledc) currently.
